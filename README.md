# kujira-fin-market-making
Supports market making of [FIN](https://fin.kujira.app/) exchange.

# How does this works?
This code is a server that runs a bot for market making. 
It simply maintains the asset ratio of the current wallet and buys when the price goes down,
and sells when the price goes up.  

> Now only support tested **KUJI/axlUSD** be careful and test with your penny money. 

You can check the transaction log in the channel.
